Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Use proper casing for 'hip' and 'hiprtc' packages.

* Package names are case-sensitive, and the name for both of these is lowercase.
* There are situations where the wrong casing can be made to work (i.e. if you manually specify "-DHIP_DIR=" and "-DHIPRTC_DIR=" config vars with the wrong case, the search procedure will happen to work in this very narrow case, but it isn't right).
* For legacy reasons, ROCM actually does *also* have a "HIP" (uppercase) package (a "module" package, not a "config" package, which is what is saving the day here because the "config" version is being requested). The right one for this case is "hip".

References:

* Docs: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/conceptual/cmake-packages.html#consuming-the-hip-api-in-c-code
* CMake find_package search procedure for prefix searches in config mode: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#config-mode-search-procedure
* Concrete locations of config files in the SDK: `lib/cmake/hiprtc/hiprtc-config.cmake` and `lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake`
