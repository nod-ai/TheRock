Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Use build RPATH correctly.

* Using BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is *only* ever valid if the build and install trees share the same layout and both should have the same origin-relative setup. That is not the case here, and the proper thing to do is to rely on CMake to make sure that RPATHs for the build tree are absolute (which is its normal invariant) and to only use the install RPATH for install.
* Hard-coding of an LD_LIBRARY_PATH to a presumed installed ROCM is not allowed and is dangerous. It is also not necessary if the build RPATHs are managed by CMake vs being overriden.
* Even if the above were true, it is not portable and would need to be contained to just on Linux for a non empty ROCM_DIR.
