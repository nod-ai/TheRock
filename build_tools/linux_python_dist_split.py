"""Given ROCm artifacts directories, performs surgery to re-layout them for
distribution as Python packages. This does not actually do the Python packaging
but just prepares a directory structure that can be overlaid with
`packaging/python` to build all packages.

This process involves both a re-organization of the sources and some surgical
alterations.

Example
-------

```
./build_tools/linux_python_dist_split.py \
    --artifact-dir ./output-linux-portable/build/artifacts \
    --dest-dir $HOME/tmp/packages
```

Note that this does do some dynamic compilation of files and it performs
patching via patchelf. It is recommended to run this in the same portable
Linux container as was used to build the SDK (so as to avoid the possibility
of accidentally referencing too-new glibc symbols).

Relayout
--------
We generally split into the following top-level python packages (which correlate
to dist package names but include an additional version suffix):

* `rocm_sdk_core{_suffix}`: Target independent core libraries, including
  runtimes, bundled sysdeps, comgr and compiler shared libraries sufficient
  to use the RTC.
* `rocm_sdk_libraries[_target_family]{_suffix}`: Kernel libraries, including
  BLAS, FFT, RAND, MIOpen, etc. These contain target specific code. See
  below `Fat and Thin Target Packages`.
* `rocm_sdk_devel{_suffix}`: All remaining assets that are needed to compile
  arbitrary programs against the ROCm SDK. Note that this package is special
  in several ways and will be discussed separately.

Note that Python distributed packages (i.e. wheel files) are named with dashes,
per usual, and they do not include the version suffix nonce that we encode into
the on-disk directory layout in site-lib. We include this extra version suffix
nonce on disk because Python packaging versioning is not precise, and because
these pieces are not interchangeable with different released versions.
Embedding a nonce gives us a point of control to ensure that things that
directly link together actually show up at distribution time that way. If this
invariant were ever violated, the usual bevy of C++ linkage issues would
make things very hard to troubleshoot (whereas with embedded nonces, we can
even include Python level diagnostics and helpful suggestions). This way,
we can detect mismatches in Python code and triage accordingly.

Surgical Alterations
--------------------
Python packages have a number of idiosynchracies that make them somewhat
hostile for distributing native software components. Chief among these is
that symlinks are simply materialized as discrete copies. This breaks a number
of assumptions regarding how Unix libraries are laid out.

The compromise we make is that the (majority of) libraries are only materialized
as their SONAME component in the non devel package. This is what the operating
system actually looks for at runtime and in the majority of cases, is
sufficient to operate the software. By and large, the ROCm software and LLVM
follows this convention closely enough to allow us to do this. We then
materialize all names/symlinks in the devel package, which we do not
distribute through symlink-unclean channels (there are other peculiarities of
the devel package which are out of scope of this topic -- see below).

The issue arises because a standard Unix library is symlinked like this:

```
libamd_comgr.so -> libamd_comgr.so.2
libamd_comgr.so.2 -> libamd_comgr.so.2.9
libamd_comgr.so.2.9
```

But the SONAME is `libamd_comgr.so.2` -- a symlink that we would like to
avoid (and the only file that matters at runtime). This makes some sense in an
OS context where you may have multiple patch versions of a library co-existing
and being arbitrated by symlink. But it doesn't fit our constraints. So we
"rotate" all link farms: In the normal packages, we only materialize the SONAME
variant (the middle one above) as a real file. In devel packages with shared
libraries that were materialized in a runtime package, we symlink back to the
runtime package version.

The ROCm and LLVM distribution also includes a number of executable symlink,
many of the form:

```
clang*
amdclang -> clang
```

Critically, all such symlinks are relative. We replace them with a stub
executable that we compile as part of the script which can perform the
dynamic path computation and exec() the intended target.

There are other alterations we have to make to accomodate our uniquely split
layout on disk.

Fat and Thin Target Packages
----------------------------
Target specific packages (aka `libraries`) can either be fat or thin:

* Fat target packages will contain independent host+device code in their own
  dedicated tree joined together. For multi-target packaging scenarios, there
  will be one per family, and the top-level `rocm-sdk` package will contain
  the meta-data mapping actual devices to subsets. Such packages will be
  named with a `_target_family` in the name. For development or single-host
  use, we support distribution of a single tree with no target-specific
  indirection (i.e. does not contain the `_target_family`).
* Thin target packages contain target-neutral host code in a non target specific
  directory tree, and then all device code/kernel databases are located
  separately and loaded via an interposer.

Thin target packages are currently in the conceptual phase but are intended to
be the final default packaging mechanism for multi-target builds.

Development Package
-------------------
The `-devel` package is unique because it is the catch-all for any distributed
files that are materialized in one of the above packages. For anything that is
materialized in a prior package, a relative symlink is generated across the
root directory to the named package directory. Since the development package
contains symlink farms, it cannot be included verbatim in a Python wheel (which
would try to materialize the symlinks). Instead, we *embed* it as a .tar.xz
file in a built wheel at Python package construction time. Then code that
needs to get the ROCm `cmake_prefix_path()` or run any tools will dynamically
decompress it to the HOME directory, setup root links, and run from there.

Note that most users never will need the development package: it exists to
build projects such as PyTorch, et al, for distribution against specific
`rocm-sdk` packages. If not building or using the CLI development tools, it
is not needed.

Since the development package is not meant to be used at runtime, it references
a fat target package for a default target, regardless of what hardware may be
physically installed on the machine. Since this is just used for linking, this
should be fine and allows builds to run reproducibly on non-GPU systems.
